# Subscription & Monetization Strategy

This document outlines the planned approach for monetizing the AlphaFlow app, including when and how users are prompted to pay, what features are gated, and the fallback experience for non-paying users.

## 1. When to Prompt for Payment
- **Usage-Based Trigger:**
  - After a user has used the app for a certain period (e.g., 7 days) **or**
  - After reaching a milestone (e.g., Level 3 in guided mode)
- The app will notify users that advanced analytics and an ad-free experience are available with a premium upgrade.

## 2. Payment Options
- **Subscription Fee:**
  - Recurring payment (monthly/yearly) for continued access to premium features.
- **One-Time Payment:**
  - Lifetime access to premium features for a single payment.
- The app may offer both options, allowing users to choose.

## 3. Premium Features (Unlocked with Payment)
- **Advanced Analytics:**
  - All features described in `Analytics_Premium_Features.md` (personalized feedback, advanced visualizations, time-based analytics, etc.)
- **Ad-Free Experience:**
  - No ads shown anywhere in the app.

## 4. Non-Premium Experience (If User Does Not Pay)
- **Basic Analytics Only:**
  - Users retain access to the current/basic analytics page (XP summary, radar chart, skill breakdown).
- **All Core Features Unlocked:**
  - Users can continue using all main app features (task management, routines, etc.) without restriction.
- **Ads Displayed:**
  - Ads will be shown in the app (placement and frequency to be determined).
- **Advanced Analytics Disabled:**
  - Premium analytics features are locked and clearly marked as premium.

## 5. Flexibility for Future
- Pricing, ad models, and feature gating can be adjusted based on user feedback and business needs.
- Potential to add more premium features or adjust what is included in the free tier.

**Goal:**
Monetize the app in a way that rewards engaged users, provides real value for premium, but does not block core functionality for free users.
