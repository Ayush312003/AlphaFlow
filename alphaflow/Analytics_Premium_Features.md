# Advanced Analytics Features for Premium Users

This document outlines proposed advanced analytics features for the premium version of AlphaFlow, focusing on delivering deeper insights, motivation, and value to users.

## 1. Personalized Feedback

- **Weekly Improvement Suggestions**
  - Show messages like: "You improved your Physical skill by 18% this week!"
  - Highlight areas of most improvement and areas needing attention.
  - Provide actionable suggestions (e.g., "Try adding a new task in the Learning category to balance your skills.")

- **Milestone Celebrations**
  - Notify users when they reach new XP milestones, streaks, or complete a set number of tasks.
  - Visual badges or animations for achievements.

## 2. More Visualizations

- **Calendar Heatmaps**
  - Visualize daily XP/task completion as a heatmap (e.g., GitHub-style calendar grid).
  - Quickly spot streaks, missed days, and high-activity periods.

- **Pie Charts & Bar Graphs**
  - Pie chart: Distribution of XP or completed tasks by skill/category.
  - Bar graph: XP earned per week/month, or per skill over time.

- **Trend Lines**
  - Show progress over time for each skill (line chart: XP vs. time).
  - Highlight "best days" and "most improved skill" visually.

## 3. Time-Based Analytics

- **XP Gained Per Week/Month**
  - Weekly/monthly summaries of XP earned, with comparison to previous periods ("+12% vs. last week").

- **Best Days**
  - Highlight days with highest XP/task completion.
  - Optionally, show what tasks contributed most on those days.

- **Most Improved Skill**
  - Identify which skill/category saw the largest improvement in a given period.

- **Recommendations**
  - Suggest actions based on analytics (e.g., "You haven't completed a Spiritual task in 5 days. Try one today!")

- **Comparison to Previous Periods**
  - Show side-by-side stats for current vs. previous week/month (XP, tasks, streaks, etc.).

## 4. (Planned for Future) Social/Competitive Features

- Leaderboards, friend comparisons, and community stats will be considered after implementing authentication (e.g., Google Sign-In).
